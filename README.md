# üá´üá∑ Franki ‚Äî From Netflix to Native

Franki is a French subtitle mining assistant that helps language learners turn TV shows into personalized vocabulary flashcards ‚Äî **automatically**.

Inspired by my grandma‚Äôs old Larousse dictionary game, Franki brings slow, deliberate vocabulary discovery back into the digital age ‚Äî from clipboard to Anki.

## ‚ú® What It Does

Franki listens to your **clipboard** and:

1. Detects new subtitles (e.g. copied via the [ASBPlayer extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/asbplayer-language-learni/hkledmpjpaehamkiehglnbelcpdflcab)).
2. Extracts **hard words** using:
   - Lemmatization via [spaCy French model](https://spacy.io/models/fr)
   - Filtering out common French words using a [top 50k frequency list](https://github.com/hermitdave/FrequencyWords)
   - Removing stopwords and named entities
3. Looks up definitions from [Larousse.fr](https://www.larousse.fr/dictionnaires/francais/)
4. Formats a clean Anki card with:
   - The subtitle for context
   - The word and its definition, including synonyms and antonyms
5. Sends the flashcard to [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) using [AnkiConnect](https://foosoft.net/projects/anki-connect/) (NOTE: you have to configure AnkiConnect first in the Anki app)
